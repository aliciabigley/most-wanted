Goal 3 —Get Descendants— Build out the functionality for returning a person’s

siblings, spouse (current only), and children. Must use iteration.

Goal 5 —Get Next of Kin— Build out the functionality for returning a person’s next of kin.
The user just needs their full name. If none is found, tell the user. To find the next of kin, using
the following order of precedence (eldest first):

1. Spouse

_____


Goal 6 —Search and Filter— Build out the functionality for finding a person based on search
criteria. The user may enter multiple (up to 5) characteristics of a user. The user should get a
list of living people back that meet all of the criteria. A user should be asked, “Please type your
search terms, separated by commas”. Your code will need to parse out the terms, and
validate them. If any of the terms don’t match the type of terms you accept, ask the user to
respecify or ‘leave blank to remove’. Must use some combination of Map, Filter, Reduce.
Types of terms you must accept:

• Age (only in the format #)

• Age Range (only in the format #-#)

• Height (only in the format #’#”)

• Weight (only in the format #lbs)

• Occupation (single word)

• Eye color (single word)

Hints and assumptions you may make:

• Start by removing spaces from the input, then split the input string on commas
• A # is a one to four digit number
• Assume that eye color and occupation can be matched to each other (interchangeable keywords)
